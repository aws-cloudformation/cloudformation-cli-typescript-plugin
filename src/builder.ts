// Lombok style builder that was part of the legacy plugin as
// part of the abandoned package @org-formation/tombok
// Copied here and kept for ease of transition

/**
 * The builder decorator creates a so-called 'builder' aspect to the class that is annotated with `@builder`.
 *
 * Whenever a class is decorated, the private constructor is generated with all fields as arguments,
 * and it is as if this constructor has been decorated with `@builder` instead.
 * Note that this constructor is only generated if you haven't written any constructors and also haven't
 * added any explicit `@xArgsConstructor` decorators. In those cases, tombok will assume an all-args
 * constructor is present and generate code that uses it; this means you'd get a compiler error if this
 * constructor is not present.
 *
 * The effect of `@builder` is that an inner class is generated named `TBuilder`,
 * with a private constructor. Instances of `TBuilder` are made with the method named
 * `builder()` which is also generated for you in the class itself (not in the builder class).
 *
 * The `TBuilder` class contains 1 method for each parameter of the decorated class, which returns
 * the builder itself. The builder also has a `build()` method which returns a completed instance of
 * the original type, created by passing all parameters as set via the various other methods in the
 * builder to the constructor or method that was decorated with `@builder`. The return type of this
 * method will be the same as the relevant class, unless a method has been decorated, in which case
 * it'll be equal to the return type of that method.
 *
 * Example:
 * ```typescript
 * ï¼ builder
 * class Person {}
 *
 * Person.builder()
 *   .name('Adam Savage').city('San Francisco')
 *   .job('Mythbusters').job('Unchained Reaction')
 *   .build();
 * ```
 *
 * @param <T> Type of the base class that must contain a constructor
 * @param {T} target Base class that we are going to mutate
